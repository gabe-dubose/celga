Study title: Reduced signatures of gene organization and duplication in shaping stage-specific patterns of expression across the C. elegans life cycle

Study objective: To examine assocaitions between patterns of non-random gene organization, gene duplication, and stage-specific patterns of gene expression across the C. elegans life cycle (used as a model with a simpler life cycle than other model organisms).
